                        <p class="lead"> Prehistoric art, in particular, is very important because it gives us insight into the development of the human mind and ways. Evidence of artistic thinking in hominids dates back 290,000 years ago; the Palaeolithic age. From holes in the wall to elaborate frescos, art shows us that there was more to our prehistoric ancestors than neanderthalic behaviour. Following this, people realised that one hand was stronger and more precise, so tools were also often used with that hand. This led to hand dominance. </p>

                        <p class="lead">The first signs of artistic thinking and capability were shown in Bhimbetka, India, 290,000 BCE. One example of this is the murals that were often used to depict and map out what early humans believed to be their spiritual journey which they created while intoxicated. This suggests that art held specific meaning for people which may also indicate that painting was a possible first sign of independent thought and opinion.Prehistoric paintings also often included some form of wildlife. Some may think this is a depiction of the muralists daily life, but the animals on the walls of most caves actually represent animal guardians. The prehistoric people painted them to protect both themselves and the spirit of the animal.</p>

                        <p class="lead"> Judging from ancient art, the majority of prehistoric artists were right handed, and that predominance is still seen to this day. In addition to the use of brushes and tools, brain development and growth also contributed to handedness. As this happened, one side of the brain grew to be more dominant, thereby resulting in the corresponding hand becoming dominant. For instance, if you are left handed, the right side of your brain is dominant. At first, though, prehistoric artists didnt notice this because they used both hands proportionally. The reason not everyone is right-handed, though, is because having the right hemisphere of your brain be dominant could have been useful during prehistoric times. It was proven that left-handed people had exceptional memory of landmarks, good direction, and were particularly skilled at navigation in unfamiliar terrain.
